Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

esports professional teams information for the games Dota 2 and Counter Strike Global Offensive.
index.html contains the landing page from where the user can select a game or can go to about section from
navbar. Once selected any game , it will redirect to its html page and show the esports team
for different regions in a card format including the players involved and their nationalities.
I have met almost all requirements as stated in the doc. Had fun making this project.
